        <p>SET is a game of fast-thinking fun! A SET is three cards where each feature, when looked at individually, is either all the same OR all different. Each card contains four features: color (red, purple or green), shape (oval, squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or outlined).</p>
        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>SET is a speed game. Race to find as many SETs as fast as you can. Click on a card to select it. Select three cards to submit a SET. </p>
